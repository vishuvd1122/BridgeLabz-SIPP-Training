📚 Branch Overview
🔹 Core_Java Branch
This branch contains foundational Java concepts and practice problems organized into folders:

📁 Arrays
Java programs and exercises related to array operations and implementations.

📁 Control Flows
Practice problems covering conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).

📁 EXTRAS-Built_In_Function
Java programs using Java's built-in functions and utilities.

📁 Java Programming Elements
Core language constructs like variables, data types, and operators.

📁 Methods
Java method definitions, calling methods, return types, and parameter handling.

📁 Strings
String manipulation, common operations, and string-related problems.

📁 level01
Beginner-level Java practice problems to strengthen understanding of basic concepts.

📁 level02
Intermediate-level challenges and coding problems to reinforce Java skills.

🔹 OOPs Branch
It will include object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

📁 Constructors
Learn how constructors are used to initialize objects in Java.

📁 OOPs_Level01
Basic-level OOP concepts and Java class designs.

📁 OOPs_Level02
Intermediate OOP topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.

📁 This_Static_Final
Practice programs demonstrating the use of this, static, and final keywords.

🔹 Workshop Branch
This branch features hands-on Java mini-projects applying real-world scenarios and object-oriented principles.

🍵 BookBuddy
A console-based book management system where users can:

Add books by title and author
Display all books
Search books by author's name
🛠️ Concepts used: ArrayList, constructors, method interaction, user input handling

🍵️ QuizResultProcessor
A console-driven quiz evaluator that:

Accepts correct answers and user inputs
Calculates scores and assigns grades (A – F)
Throws a custom exception for invalid submissions
🛠️ Concepts used: Custom Exception (InvalidQuizSubmissionException), List, encapsulation, grading logic

🍵 FlightBookingSystem
An airline booking simulation:

Search for flights by destination
Book flights with flight numbers
View all passenger bookings
🛠️ Concepts used: Classes (Flight, Booking), ArrayList, string matching, input flow

🍵 StudentRecord
A student performance tracker:

Accepts names, subjects, and marks
Displays average marks and grades per subject
Validates marks between 0 and 100
🛠️ Concepts used: Arrays, conditionals, loop-based validation, method abstraction

🍵 CinemaTime
A movie schedule and search manager:

Add movies with showtime (24-hour format only)
Display all movies and search by title keyword
Print a final report of all scheduled movies
🛠️ Concepts used: Input validation using Custom Exception, Use of ArrayList to store movie data, String pattern matching and formatted console output
